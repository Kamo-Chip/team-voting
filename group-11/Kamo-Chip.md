## Biogrpahy

I'm a 3rd CS student at wits. I like JavaScript.

## Highlights

- ArUco Marker Integration: Got the ESP32-CAM feed reliably detecting player markers.
- Real-Time Lobby: Implemented join/ready flow and countdown using Socket.io events.
- Spectator Mode: Added logic so late-joining or extra players automatically become spectators.
- Symbol Rebalance: Ensured player symbols stay in sync when players leave or join.

## Difficulties

- Asynchronous State Bugs: Debugging race conditions between lobby updates and game starts.
- Version Control Hiccups: Merging feature branches caused some deleted-file conflicts.
- Responsive Layout: Making the UI work smoothly across desktop and mobile views.
